<h1>Owning a Cat</h1>
<p>The most common reason to keep a pet is for companionship, so this benefit won't come as a surprise to anyone.</p>
<p>People who don't have a cat in their lives often believe that cats are unsocial, distant pets.</p>
<p>If you've ever been the recipient of an affectionate head-bunt from a friendly kitty, you know that the "unsocial" myth is indeed a myth. Cats are not the solitary animals that they had been believed to be.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Cats might not need much exercise, compared to dogs and rabbits, but they do like to play with their human companions. Tossing a toy mouse around the living room can get you moving a bit, too.</p>
<p></p>
<p>People sometimes accuse their friends of turning their pet into a substitute child.</p>
<p>By replacing a child or younger sibling as "something to nurture", a pet often does serve that need.</p>
<p>In today's smaller families, that isn't necessarily a bad thing. </p>
<p>Everybody needs somebody to love, furry or otherwise.</p>
