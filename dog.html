<h1>Owning a Dog</h1>
<h2>Why do you want a dog?</h2>
<p> It's a simple question, but one many people fail to ask themselves before they get a dog. </p>
<p>Getting a dog just because it's "the thing to do," or because your children have been begging for a puppy can end up being a big mistake.</p>
<p>Remember that you will be responsible for caring for your new family member for up to 15 years.</p>
<h2>Is there enough time in your life for a dog?</h2>
<p> Dogs are pack animals and you are part of their new pack. </p>
<p>They are companion animals and cannot be ignored just because you're busy or too tired to deal with them.</p>
<p>They require a lot of care, which includes feeding, exercising, and socializing â€“ dogs need companionship every day.</p>
<p>Many wonderful dogs end up in shelters because their owners didn't have the time to train and care for them.</p>
<h2>Can you afford a dog?</h2>
<p>The costs of caring for a dog throughout her life can be expensive.</p>
<p>Healthcare, training classes, grooming, food, toys, treats, boarding, and other expenses add up fast. </p>
